# ideablr
www.ideablr.com was a website created for the Business Professionals of America (BPA) Web Design Team Competition. The theme was to build a DIY website, and thus, Ideablr was born as a social media platform for users to share creative and simple DIYs.

The team included Madeline Huang (Web Designer), Jayleen Li (Web Programmer), and Andrea Arce (Content Writer) and computed during the year 2016-2017 and was awarded as a finalist at the State level. 

Since then, the website's domain and file hosting has expired, resulting in an unviewable website, as the source files were written in PHP. To view the original files and database, head over to https://github.com/jayleenli/ideablr.com.

I've been able to revert most of the site from PHP back to HTML so that it can be viewed as intended. However, much of the site's capabilities (search bar, profile creation, commenting, article creation, favoriting, notifications, etc.) are nulled. I created a simulated profile, so the user can see what the profile page and index page looked like when logged in. None of the articles are viewable.

You can view the HTML site at https://madelinehuang.github.io/ideablr/.
